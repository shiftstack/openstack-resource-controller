# Import Subnet

## Step 00

Import a subnet, matching all of the available filter's fields, and verify it is waiting for the external resource to be created.

## Step 01

Create a subnet which name is a superstring of the one specified in the import filter, and otherwise matching the filter, and verify that it's not being imported.

## Step 02

Create a subnet matching the filter and verify that the observed status on the imported subnet corresponds to the spec of the created subnet.
Also verify that the created subnet didn't adopt the one which name is a superstring of it.

## TODO

Possibly check that adding a new subnet matching the import filter does not cause issues after it successfully imported the first one.
